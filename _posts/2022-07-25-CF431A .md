# Think how can solve this problem


    
# Go to code!!

```python
    class Solution():
     
        def calories_that_jury_wastes():
            calories= list(map(int, input().split()))
            square_appears = input()
            total_calories = 0
            for square in square_appears:
                total_calories += calories[int(square)-1]
            return total_calories
     
     
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(Solution.calories_that_jury_wastes())
