Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

**Input**

The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

**Output**

If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

# Examples

### **Input**
```
wjmzbmr
```
### **Output**
```
CHAT WITH HER!
```
### **Input**
```
xiaodao

### **Output**

### **Input**

### **Output**

# Get the data to start working

*Input:*<br>
string  

**username** = string  

# Think how can solve this problem
1. We have to identify if the  **username** has oven or odd distinct characters.
1. Create **username_distinct_character**.
2. Iterate each **character** in username.
3. If the **character** not in **username_distinct_characters** append this character for get only the unique characters.
4. If the length of **username_distinct_characters** is odd return "CHAT WITH HER!" and if is even reteurn "IGNORE HIM!"
    
# Go to code!!

```python
    class Solution():
     
        def is_boy_or_girl():
            username = input()
            username_distinct_characters = ""
            for character in username:
                if character not in username_distinct_characters:
                    username_distinct_characters += character
            if len(username_distinct_characters) % 2 == 0:
                return 'CHAT WITH HER!'
            else:
                return 'IGNORE HIM!'
     
     
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(Solution.is_boy_or_girl())
```
