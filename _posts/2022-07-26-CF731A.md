Grigoriy, like the hero of one famous comedy film, found a job as a night security guard at the museum. At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.

Embosser is a special devise that allows to "print" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:

After Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.

Our hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible. Help him, for the given string find the minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it.

**Input**

The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit — the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters. It's guaranteed that the string consists of only lowercase English letters.

**Output**

Print one integer — the minimum number of rotations of the wheel, required to print the name given in the input.


# Examples

### **Input**
```

```
### **Output**

# Think how can solve this problem

1. Import the string module to save the alphabet in **abc**.
2. Save in **word** the input, in **rotations_of_the_wheel** the total rotations you need to the **word**.
3. Use two pointers to know if the letter ir more close to the left or right.
4. For each letter count how many letter there are between the current letter and the next, compare them and the less adding to the **rotations_of_the_wheel**.
5. In each iteration verify if the **left_pointer** and the **right_pointer** are the target letter. If not, increment **left_pointer** by 1 and decrease **right_pointer** by 1.
5. If the **left_index** are equal to end of **abc** go back to the begin, and the same with **right_index** if this is in the end.
5. Save the index of the current letter in **left_index** and **right_index**
6. Return **rotations_of_the_wheel**.


    
# Go to code!!

```python
    import string
    class Solution():
     
        def number_of_rotations_of_the_wheel():
            abc = string.ascii_lowercase
            word = input()
            rotations_of_the_wheel = 0
            left_index, right_index = 0, 0
     
            for letter in word:
                left_counter, right_counter = 0, 0
     
                while abc[left_index] != letter and abc[right_index] != letter:
                    right_index -= 1
                    left_counter += 1
                    right_counter += 1
     
                    if left_index == len(abc)-1:
                        left_index = 0
                    else:
                        left_index += 1
     
                if left_counter < right_counter:
                    rotations_of_the_wheel += left_counter
                else:
                    rotations_of_the_wheel += right_counter
     
                left_index, right_index = abc.index(letter), abc.index(letter)
                
            return rotations_of_the_wheel
     
     
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(Solution.number_of_rotations_of_the_wheel())
