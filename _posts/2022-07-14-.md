# Get the data to start working

*Input:*  
**a** **b**

limak_weight = **a**  
bob_weight = **b**


# Think how can solve this problem
1. **limak_weight** starts out equal to or less than **bob_weight** and has to end up being greater than **bob_weight**
2. Each year **limak_weight** grows 3 times and **bob_weight** 2 times.
3. We can create the variable **years** to know how many years have passed.
4. Iterate, multipliying the **limak_weight** by 3 and **bob_weight** by 2, and increasing by the **years**.
5. Return how many **years** have passed.

    
# Go to code!!

```python
    class Solution():
     
        def years_to_limak_become_strictly_large_than_bob():
            limak_weight, bob_weight = map(int, input().split())
            years = 0
     
            while limak_weight <= bob_weight:
                limak_weight *= 3
                bob_weight *= 2
                years += 1
     
            return years
     
     
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(Solution.years_to_limak_become_strictly_large_than_bob())
```
