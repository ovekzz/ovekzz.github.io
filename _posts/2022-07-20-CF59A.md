Vasya is very upset that many people on the Net mix uppercase and lowercase letters in one word. That's why he decided to invent an extension for his favorite browser that would change the letters' register in every word so that it either only consisted of lowercase letters or, vice versa, only of uppercase ones. At that as little as possible letters should be changed in the word. For example, the word HoUse must be replaced with house, and the word ViP — with VIP. If a word contains an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, you should replace all the letters with lowercase ones. For example, maTRIx should be replaced by matrix. Your task is to use the given method on one given word.

**Input**

The first line contains a word s — it consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and possesses the length from 1 to 100.

**Output**

Print the corrected word s. If the given word s has strictly more uppercase letters, make the word written in the uppercase register, otherwise - in the lowercase one.

# Examples

### **Input**
```
HoUse
```
### **Output**
```
house
```
### **Input**
```
ViP
```
### **Output**
```
VIP
```
### **Input**
```
maTRIx
```
### **Output**
```
matrix
```

# Get the data to start working

*First line input:*<br>

*Second line:*<br>

# Think how can solve this problem
1. We have to return the word input in uppercase if the uppercase letters are most than the lowercase letters, in otherwise return the word in lowercase.
2. Create **upper_letters** as a counter.
3. Iterate the **word**.
4. If the **letter** is in uppercase increment **upper_letters** by 1.
5. If **upper_letter** multiply by 2 is greater than the length of the **word** return the **word** in uppercase, else return the word in lowercase.

    
# Go to code!!

```python
    class Solution():
     
        def letters_changed():
            word = input()
            upper_letters = 0
     
            for letter in word:
                if letter == letter.upper():
                    upper_letters += 1
            return word.upper() if upper_letters*2 > len(word) else word.lower()
     
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(Solution.letters_changed())
```
