# About me

Hi! 👋   
My name is Kevin Carrizo (also known as ovekzz) and this is my personal blog where I upload my progress in the journey of code and at least one daily post explaining how i think and solve problems from coding challeges websites using Python as main language.  
I will also occasionally post about computer science topics.

Yes, this is a representation of me... or something like that, but i don't sitting so right.  
👀 Interested in Backend projects and constantly self-learning about software development.  
💞️ Enthusiast in how to make my code better, efficient and readeable with python.  
🌱 Currently learnig data structure and algorithms and improving my problem solving skills.

# Studies

In the past I tried to go to the university of systems engineering because it's what I was supposed to do if I liked computer things and coding. I know, bad decision, had so many administration subjects and little programming and eventually I left it...  
It was not a good time for me :(

But this year I came back to the University!!!  
I'm currently computer science student in the "Cero + Infinito", the new campus of exact and nature sciences in the UBA (University of Buenos Aires), I discover this carrer after thinking a lot what to do with my studies and when i see the study plan the decision was made, I love all the subjects that i am going to take and I'm very excited for all that I will learn, especially about A.I.
