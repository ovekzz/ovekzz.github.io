Hi, my name is Kevin Carrizo and currently I am computer science student interested in Backend projects and constantly self-learning about software development.
Enthusiast in how to make my code better, efficient and readeable with Python.
I do coding challenges daily and write about what I'm thinking and how to solve these problems to improving my code and communication skills explaining my code and maybe help others to improve too.
